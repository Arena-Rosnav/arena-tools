# Create a Gazebo map from the occupancy map
Creating a Gazebo map from the 2D occupancy map, created by *arena-tools* can be broken down into six steps

❶ [Transform the `pgm` file into an `svg`](#1-transform-the-pgm-file-into-an-svg)

❷ [Open the `svg` in Blender](#2-open-the-svg-in-blender)

❸ [Scale and Extrude the `svg`](#3-scale-and-extrude-the-svg)

❹ [Convert to `mesh`](#4-convert-to-mesh)

❺ [(Optinal) simplify the world for higher simulation speed](#5-optinal-simplify-the-world-for-higher-simulation-speed)

❻ [Include the mesh into the world file and save the file](#6-include-the-mesh-into-the-world-file-and-save-the-file)

### 1. Transform the `pgm` file into an `svg`

### 2. Open the `svg` in Blender

### 3. Scale and Extrude the `svg`

### 4. Convert to `mesh`

### 5. (Optinal) simplify the world for higher simulation speed

### 6. Include the mesh into the world file and save the file
